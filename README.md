# bioinformatica-16S
This repository contains scripts, workflows, and documentation for 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, focused on microbial community profiling. It provides step-by-step guidance for processing raw sequencing data (FASTQ files), performing quality control, and generating taxonomic and diversity analyses.

Main Features

*Import, quality filtering, and trimming of FASTQ files

*OTU/ASV clustering and taxonomic assignment

*Alpha and beta diversity analysis

*Visualization of microbial composition and community structure

*Reproducible workflows using QIIME2, DADA2, and R
